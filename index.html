				I've been wanting to get back into drawing for a while so, recently I got myself a Surface Pro to replace my aging laptop. The Pro has been great to get back into drawing and learning to do so digitally. Combine that with my love for my two pups Sybil and Lulu, and my fascination with super bright off color works lately and you get Space Dogs! I started with two reference photos of my pups, and had this idea of them being opposites but also contained within one another in some way, very yin and yang. So the first pup is on this all pink background in the sun, very active but is filled in with the stars, while the other is on the starry background, glowing like the sky of the first while sleeping. I'm super thrilled with how these turned out definitely inspired to draw some more!

			<h1>CSS Grid Art</h1>

			<p>
				A few Months back I had stumbled across <a href="https://generative-art-with-css.commons.host/" target="_blank" >this article</a> by Yuan Chuan about creating generative art with css grid. It inspired me to try some of these technics and create some things myself. Working this way with css grid was a total blast and it resulted in some really cool pieces. You can see my collection of them on my <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/XJJqwo/" target="_blank">codepen</a>.

				<h1>Welcome to Inexorable Design</h1>

					Hey! I'm Ace. I'm a designer and front end developer. I've decided to make my website into a blog! At least, the typical blog format - "a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style." I like the idea of posting up my work as I make it and I always find myself wanting to give more context about it. I also really like the idea of dating posts, It'll be cool to see the progression here over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since I have a lot of older work to post, i'm going to make this first entry in the blog a sort of history; images followed by small blurbs about the work. Let's get started!
				</p>

				<h3>kjhovey Branding</h3>
				<img src="lib/twitterMockupHovey.jpg" alt="kjhovey branding">
				<p>
					One of the first branding projects I had the pleasure of working on was for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kjhovey" target="_blank">kjhovey</a>, a popular content creator in the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/" target="_blank">Destiny</a> community. I did a custom logo for Hovey that called back to his passion and love for <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i>. I also created a custom song for the reveal of Hovey's new brand, you can listen below!

				<h3>Destiny Item Manager Contributor / Designer</h3>
				<img src="lib/dim.jpg" alt="DIM branding">
				<p>
					Working on <a href="https://destinyitemmanager.com/" target="_blank">Destiny Item Manager (DIM)</a> has been a blast and an honor. I started my journey with DIM when I was approached to design a new logo for the project so it could stand on it's own without using any of the <i>Destiny</i> intellectual property (IP). We worked together to make something that evoked both the application itself as well as Destiny. After that I stuck around and currently help with contributing code where I can as well as continuing my role in aiding with design needs.

				<h3>BrickinNick Branding</h3>
				<img src="lib/twitterMockupNick.jpg" alt="BrickinNick branding">
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brickinnick" target="_blank">BrickinNick</a> is a LEGO content creator! Nick makes amazing custom LEGO builds, so we worked together to create a brand that would echo his LEGO building prowess and his love of space LEGO sets. 
				</p>

				<h3>Geek Chick Branding</h3>
				<img src="lib/twitterMockupGeek.jpg" alt="Geek Chick branding">
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/geekchicktv" target="_blank">Geek</a> came to me with a very specific motif for her new logo, Pixels, RPGs, and Magical Girls. We worked on capturing that esthetic along with her already signature vapor wave style. I also created a custom chip tune track for this brand you can listen below!
